## Notes

First, challenges 3 and 4 involved building the game cards and updating the calculation of the number of contributions and goals in the "Stats" area. I encountered several bugs, such as incorrectly naming variables and using the wrong syntax, especially from the perspective of someone used to Python. Additionally, building the search bar was difficult because it needed to accept lowercase input and search character by character. I managed to accomplish this with the support of Stack Overflow and ChatGPT. Lastly, I will continue looking for more inspiration to improve the appearance of the website. =)))
